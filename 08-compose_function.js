/*
How we produce our reducer before:
isNot2Filter(isEvenFilter(doubleMap(pushReducer)))

Our compose needs to do this:
compose(f, g)(x) === f(g(x))

so:
compose(isNot2Filter, isEvenFilter, doubleMap)(pushReducer) ===
	isNot2Filter(isEvenFilter(doubleMap(pushReducer)))

Why we passing pushReducer in a argument and not leting with default?
	Becouse we want our compose function to be a combinator!
combinator is a function that creates a function with a relashionship in the functions, so we need to
knowing in functional programming by: BCombinator or Bluebird

/* Now our composition works! It works becouse the filters and map function receives and returns a reducer.
	now, let's create some function to compose this to us */
